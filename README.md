# Diabetes-Prediction

From the above csv file of Diabetes_prediction, I understand that the outcome column data is an Dependent,Supervised and Categorical Data.

This csv file is found in Github

From the above csv, we have performed Data cleaning, Feature Engineering [Encoding].

Also used Gradient Boosting Classifier Algorithm as it provides the higher level of accuracy compared to any Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Algorithm

After providing the required inputs like name, age, gender, smoking history, Hypertension, and important inputs like BMI value, Hemoglobin A1c level, Blood Glucose level, you will be shown the prediction of whether you are Diabetic or Not.
